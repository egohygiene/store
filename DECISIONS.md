# Ego Hygiene Store Decisions

## Purpose

This document preserves significant accepted architectural choices and their rationale. Issues coordinate work, proposals explore alternatives, and this file records decisions that constrain future implementation.

## Governance

Do not rewrite historical context to fit current understanding. Amend a record for corrections that do not change meaning; supersede it with a new record when the decision changes materially.

## Index

- ADR-001: Normalize providers behind a commerce port
- ADR-002: Use hosted checkout
- ADR-003: Deploy independently beneath the /store route

## ADR-001: Normalize providers behind a commerce port

- **Status:** Accepted as the current architectural direction
- **Date:** 2026-08-19
- **Context:** Repository evidence and ecosystem ownership require an explicit durable boundary.
- **Decision:** Normalize providers behind a commerce port.
- **Consequences:** The choice improves ownership and predictability while requiring maintained contracts, validation, and migration discipline.
- **Reconsider when:** New evidence shows that the boundary prevents standalone usefulness, safety, portability, or maintainability.

## ADR-002: Use hosted checkout

- **Status:** Accepted as the current architectural direction
- **Date:** 2026-08-19
- **Context:** Repository evidence and ecosystem ownership require an explicit durable boundary.
- **Decision:** Use hosted checkout.
- **Consequences:** The choice improves ownership and predictability while requiring maintained contracts, validation, and migration discipline.
- **Reconsider when:** New evidence shows that the boundary prevents standalone usefulness, safety, portability, or maintainability.

## ADR-003: Deploy independently beneath the /store route

- **Status:** Accepted as the current architectural direction
- **Date:** 2026-08-19
- **Context:** Repository evidence and ecosystem ownership require an explicit durable boundary.
- **Decision:** Deploy independently beneath the /store route.
- **Consequences:** The choice improves ownership and predictability while requiring maintained contracts, validation, and migration discipline.
- **Reconsider when:** New evidence shows that the boundary prevents standalone usefulness, safety, portability, or maintainability.

## Open decisions

- Release and compatibility policy for the first stable version.
- Exact self-hosted, managed, and organization-integrated deployment boundaries.
- Which target systems must exist before the architecture status may become active.

## Evidence and uncertainty

- **Observed:** The repository README establishes the intended boundary as a provider-neutral React and Vite storefront for the egohygiene.io store experience; significant implementation remains incomplete.
- **Decided for this draft:** The repository owns the bounded concern described here and participates through versioned contracts.
- **Proposed:** Target systems and later roadmap phases remain proposals until accepted and implemented.
- **Open question:** Which parts of this draft should become active in the first independently versioned release?
